abstract: |
    From a startup to a multinational corporation the software development industry is currently dominated by agile frameworks and product teams and as part of it DevOps strategies.

    It has been observed that during implementation, security aspects can be missed. The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model and the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which are presented in the talk, show security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures can defend against attacks.

    In this session Timo will give an introduction and answer questions like when to use OWASP SAMM and when and how to use DSOMM.
