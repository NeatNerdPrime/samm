## Agenda

We received several proposals for talks and workshops and want to thank you all for getting in touch. We had to narrow the list down to fit our half-a-day event, so here it is! There will be more opportunities to share your experience with the community.

## More User Days

In 2021 we'll have 2 User Days, one on May 27th and another one around November.

Based on feedback from last year, we decided to have 2 shorter User Days instead of just one that lasts all day.

## Archive

You can always visit last year's SAMM User Day page, where you can see the full list of talks, with downloadable material and YouTube links.
