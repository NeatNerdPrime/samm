## More User Days

In 2021 we'll have 2 User Days, one on May 27th and another one around November.

Based on feedback from last year, we decided to have 2 shorter User Days instead of just one that lasts all day.

## Agenda

We received several proposals for talks and workshops and want to thank you all for getting in touch. We had to narrow the list down to fit our half-a-day event, so here it is! There will be more opportunities to share your experience with the community.

Don't forget to keep coming back to this page for more information as we get closer to May 27th.
